# sentiment-analysis-app
This is a Streamlit web app for sentiment analysis of e-commerce reviews. It uses VADER, Bag of Words + Naive Bayes, and TF-IDF + Naive Bayes models to predict whether a review is positive or negative. Users can enter their own review and see results from all three models instantly.

App Description: Sentiment Analysis Web App
This Streamlit web application performs sentiment analysis on e-commerce product reviews using three different natural language processing approaches:

VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary for Sentiment Reasoning)

Bag of Words + Naive Bayes Classifier

TF-IDF + Naive Bayes Classifier

Users can input any text review, and the app will display predicted sentiment (positive or negative) using all three models. The models were trained on a labeled dataset of e-commerce reviews and evaluate text after stopword removal for improved accuracy.

This project showcases NLP preprocessing, feature extraction, and sentiment classification â€” all wrapped in an interactive and user-friendly web interface.
